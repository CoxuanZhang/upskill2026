        <h1>Exploring Vallor's <br>Techomoral Virtues</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Shannon Vallor's book 'Envisioning the Good Life in 21th Century and Beyond' theories the self-cultivation of new techno-morals to guide a ;good life in the age of emerging technologies. Instead of enforcing rigid principles or calculating maximization of profit, Vallor underscores the philosophy of virtue ethics - habituation of moral awareness to acquire a practical wisdom. The dogmatic moral code of you shall not lie, for example, is no longer sufficient in the cyberworld of false information and conspiracy theories. However, the relative and situational understanding of honesty does root in personal reflections and awareness Vallor guides us to cultivate. Vallors virtue ethics arent rare in the contemporary world. Consumption of media as a personal and self-driven action has become one of the prime ways we build our value systems. Thereby, this project reflects on childrens media from different time and space, evaluating their relations to Vallors 12 techno-virtues.

                <h2>Honesty in "the Boy who Cried Wolf"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> The Boy who Cried Wolf is a tale from Aesops Fable showing how people lose trust in dishonest people. The protagonist, a mischievous young shepherd, falsely alarmed the villagers by crying Wolf! Wolf!. Amused by how villagers anxiously ran up to him, he did it again and again. His dishonesty broke the unspoken premise of trust behind our kindness. Therefore, no one offered him help when wolves actually came for his sheep. </p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection:</strong> Even in our polarizing world of information technology, everyone still looks for a common truth, which steers care, civility, and many other virtues. Vallors honesty entails not a dogmatic belief in truth but a respect in when and where and to whom in sharing your truth. The boy who cried wolf as a classical childrens story exemplifies the oneness in truth and the social consequences of challenging it.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Self-Control in "Hansel and Gretel"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Hansel and Gretel is a part of Brother Grimms fairytale collection, which tells a story about childrens overindulgence. Hansel and Gretel, two children of an impoverished family, were abandoned by their stepmother in the woods. The starving children came across a little house built entirely from bread with a roof made of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar, which they hastily ate several pieces of. However, they turned out to have been lured into the cannibal witchs trap. </p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection:</strong> Regardless of the twos eventual escape, Brother Grimm moralizes a degree of overindulgence even at times of desperate need. This echoes the Aristotelian understanding of temperance, which entails not restraining oneself but cultivating right desires. Hansel and Gretels hunger and greed attributes to the poverty and lack of care from their family. Hence, this childrens tale not only alarms children who lack self-control, but also anyone who cultivates a wrong desire within themselves</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Humility in "Fantastic Mr. Fox"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Wes Andersons film adaptation of Roald Dahls childrens book, Fantastic Mr. Fox situates each anthropomorphised character with an increasingly human dilemma. For Mr. Fox, its to come to terms with his bloated confidence over his own animal nature to be free and defy systems. The platitudes of his journalist work and family life no longer satisfies Mr. Foxs ego. Hence, he embarks on a theft scheme from Boggis, Bunce, and Beans, three landlord-farmers, to fulfill his animal nature. His failure, however, not only costs his tail but puts his whole neighborhood at risk again and again. Through rebuilding his family relations and facing his responsibilities in family life, Mr. Fox eventually lets go of his fixation upon thievery and lives a happy life of humility with loved ones. </p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection:</strong> Similarly, Vallor critiques our confidence over the human mastery, which allows technological development to blindly guide our moral values and actions. Fantastic Mr.Foxs story exemplifies the possibility for modesty and reverence to be cultivated within humanities with virtue ethics.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Justice in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong>A childrens tale written also by Roald Dahl in the 20th century shares Charlies fantastic encounters in Willy Wonkas magical chocolate factory. Wonka Bars have always lured the public with its great taste and mysterious recipe. Hence, when Wonka released five golden tickets to visit his factory, the protagonist Charlie put his very limited savings into buying two Wonka Bar, which earned him the golden ticket. Contrary to the arrogance and wealth of other winners, Charlie was timid and kind. Hence, as each child one by one is punished for their misbehavior inside the factory, Charlie became the only kid to pass the test and win Wonkas factory. </p>
                <p><Strong>Virtue Connection:</Strong>Wonkas process of selection reflects the virtue of justice in Vallors theories. Wonka deliberately challenges the asymmetrical power of wealth through the random distribution of golden tickets and fair punishment for every childs misbehaving. Charlies merits break the self-segregating values of classism in his city, which exhibits a value of fairness in Wonkas character as well as Roald Dahls writing.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Courage in "the Chronicles of Narnia"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong>Reepicheep is a talking mouse in C.S. Lewis fantasy series the Chronicles of Narnia. As the leader of all taking mice in Narnia and a crew member on King Caspians exploration to the Far East, he constantly encourages the crew to sail further into the unknown. In order to rescue the cursed Lords of Narnia in endless slumber, Reepicheep volunteers himself to sail into the end of the world and never return.</p>
                <p><Strong>Virtue Connection:</Strong>Reepicheep has a steadfast moral compass of goodness, servitude for the kingdom and truthfulness to his integrity. As a veteran, he consistently upholds his idea of goodness in combat and missions. Other than this moral courage, Reepicheep by sailing off also represents the spiritual courage Vallor praises. His bravery of leaving his status and honor behind corresponds with his beloved childhood ballads, Doubt not, Reepicheep. To find all you seek, there is the utter East. His courage in believing and pursuing spirituality is precious to modern humanity in the age of increasing materialism and conflicting truths.

            <div>
                <h2>Empathy in "Beauty and the Beast"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation: </strong>Beauty and Beast is originally a French fairytale and later popularized by its Disney adaptation. Belle, the female protagonist, exemplifies a habitual growth into  co-feeling through captivity at the Beasts castle. She spent time with the Beasts servants who are all cursed into furniture and cured the Beasts wound as he saved her from an attack. She learnt to humanize the Beasts kindness, struggles, and complexity, which culminated in another extent of empathy - love.</p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection: </strong>The alienation of the beast from human society ridicules the theme of marginalization and self-alienation in modern society. The Beast was cursed into an unappealing appearance that prohibits him from building social connections. Similarly, the Web2.0 internet users unconsciously take on prejudices that dehumanize each other, which strikes an urgency for self-cultivation of empathy. As Vallor suggested empathy as crucial to a good life in our age of technology, Belles life can be completely different without her intrinsic cultivation of empathy. Already a compassionate individual, Belle through her relationship with the Beast enriched her conscious empathy, which Vallor emphasizes more than its natural counterpart in her techno-virtue. </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Care in "Moomin Valley"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation: </strong>Moomin, originally a Finnish comic strip, features all kinds of creatures living in Moominvalley. After hearing the news of an impending comet, Moomintroll, the child of the moomin family, and his friends travel long distances to consult the professors in Lonely Mountains. Striving through the perils on their journey, he found new mates, saved each other in poisonous bushes, and survived the scary octopus.</p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection: </strong>The motive of Moomintroll shows his servitude to his community as he takes the responsibility on himself to investigate the news of a destructive comet strike. He demonstrates great care for people with his kind sensitivity to his friends needs at the hardest time. Moreover, his love for the bigger environment strikes me as a part of the care humanity needs in this age of technology</p>
                <p><i>Then he thought about how much he loved everything; the forest and the sea, the rain and the wind, the sunshine, the grass and the moss, and how impossible it would be to live without them all&</i></p>

            <div>
                <h2>Civility in "Winnie the Pooh"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation: </strong>Animated and popularized by Disney, Winnie-the-Pooh originated from the work of English author A. A. Milne and English illustrator E. H. Shepard. Winnie-the-pooh and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood celebrate, help, and spend time with each other. Pooh takes initiative in brightening up Eeyores birthday with his honey jar gift. He honorably rescues his friend piglet from the flood. He learns from his mischievous mistakes to include his new neighbors Kanga and Baby Roo into the neighborhood. Pooh maintains different relationships with everyone and positively reshapes old and new relationships to form a community.</p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection: </strong>Winnie-the-Poohs technomoral civility doesnt come from his kindness and politeness. Instead, he cultivates different levels of respect in each different community relationship he has. This honey-craving, kind-hearted, and red-shirted bear pursues simple joy, which echoes the definition of morality as to live a good life. Poohs simple happiness mainly comes from his relationships with good people of mutual trust and goodwill. Hence, Pooh naturally pulls friends into his world of simple joy and forms a joyful community altogether.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Flexibility in "the Lion King"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation: </strong>Lion Kings original Disney musical film, despite the later editions, is still one of the most top-selling movies in the box office. Simba, the young heir of the Pride Lands, was manipulated by his uncle and fled his homeland after his fathers sacrifice. He survived in the hedonistic world of Oasis with his outcast friends under the belief of "hakuna matata" (no worries). However, as he encountered his childhood friend Nara, he made the hard decision to return to his changed kingdom. Through a heated confrontation with his uncle, Simba took back his throne. </p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection: </strong>Simba went through many unpleasant changes in his life: the death of his father, the divorce from his homeland, leaving his safe haven again and again, confronting the vice of his own blood& He remained flexible by adjusting his values and accommodating the shortcomings of the people and places he was surrounded by. Simba showed equanimity in sparing his uncle, Scar, even when revealed the uncomfortable truth of Scar's evil plotting. Confucious emphasizes the upholding of correct moral standards despite the shifting experiences, which by Simba exemplifies through his unchanging courage to trust. Through the tumultuous half of Simbas life, Lion King portrays a hero that adapts and thrives.

            <div>
                <h2>Perspective in "Charlottes Web"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation: </strong>In the childrens book Charlottes Web, Charlotte, the spider, saved the life of farm pig Wilbur who was raised for slaughter. Two outcast animals living in the barnyard have limited living spaces as well as perception of the world beyond the barn. However, Charlottes kindness allowed her to not only see the bigger picture but utilize it to make Wilbur a famous pig. She fetched words from human products and weaved them into her webs, which was turned into a spectacle by tourists. Charlottes intelligent awareness of human psychology saved Wilbur and bonded the two in a friendship that transcended generations.
</p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection: </strong>The beloved book portrays how animals pursue a good life by using human intelligence and tools. Charlottes sense of larger context is precious because it observed the moral reality in the human world - fame humanizes a pig and makes slaughtering more difficult. Charlotte has amazing sensibility for engaging the rules from the outside world into their simple barn. This quality is even more cherishable in the technomoral context because we are similarly trapped by algorithms in our own echo chambers.

                <p><strong>Situation: </strong>Originally written by Roald Dahl, Matilda is adapted into musicals, films, and radio programs, which were all well-loved by its audience.

At school, she finds the headmistress Ms.Trunchbull abusing her peers with absurd punishments. Ms.Trunchbull has also illegally occupied the assets and housing of Ms.Honey, Matildas beloved teacher.

                <p><strong>Virtue Connection: </strong>Matilda is not only an intellectually ambitious character but also showcases great moral leadership and ambition. She fights back hardships courageously, never sinking into cycles of petty self-degradation.

Matilda exemplifies megalopsuchia (greatness of soul and spirit) both inside and outside of the book,

                <h2>Technomoral Virtue in "Two Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"</h2>
                <p><strong>Situation: </strong>Captain Nemo, captain of the submarine Nautilus, is first introduced in Jules Vernes revolutionary science fiction Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas in 1870. Captain Nemo is a mysterious figure that inhabits Nautilus with his crew, cutting off all connections with the land nations. With his engineering and innovative talent, he designed Nautilus as well as sourced food and clothes for their crew from sea creatures. He holds a strong moral compass of anti-imperialism due to his losses in the invasion of his past homeland, South Asia. Therefore, he rejects all trades and laws from the land nations. However, he upholds respect for knowledge and humanity regardless of his hatred for life on land. He widely reads and studies history, languages, and science. He accommodates the land citizens, Ned and Aronnax, who accidentally found the submarine during a crossfire. As the definite leader on Nautilus, He courageously spearheads into the most dangerous missions on board and mourns every crew member lost on their journey. 
</p>
                <p><strong>Virtue Connection: </strong>Captain Nemo has cultivated a civil society on board of Nautilus guided by moral codes similar to Vallors technomoral virtues. They have cultivated in themselves a drive for fairness and care between each other, which rejects the brutality of war and politics on land. Captain Nemo role-models the courage and self-control one must hold to pursue a good life in this isolated utopia. The community of Nautilus aligns with his moral pursuits and baselines, which exemplifies an respectful isolationism that many still dream to pursue in the modern world.

But thirty feet below sea level, their power ceases, their influence fades, their domination vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone do I find independence! Here I recognize no superiors! Here I'm free!

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p> In our world of technology and media, individual behaviors are capable of creating unpredictable ripples across our globe. The aristotelian value of phronsis (practical wisdom) suggests a need not only for the right actions but also temperance in our thoughts and feelings. Childrens stories are one of the first narratives that shaped the way I think and feel. Through my re-read, I noticed the anti-imperial message in Two Thousand Legal under the Seas and the different layers of care in Moomin. As Roland Barthes famously claims that The author is dead, interpretation of artistic works thickens with the passing of time. Similar to Vallors methodology, the outdated perception of the authors may no longer conform to our virtues today but the spirits of their characters outlast those limitations. I found the power of readership to continuously cultivate a reflecting consciousness. The moral value of arts not only reflects the virtue values in its authorship but also transcends the time and social context.
